# MC uncertainty propoagation

These subroutines show how uncertainty propagation can be done by MC 
instead of analytically. Simple examples are given here that will 
demonstrate the basics.

The following modules are currently available:

## Introduction to MC error propagation in Python

This notebook (with exercises) goes through random number generators and gives the basics of MC
error propagation. It also compares MC error propagation directly with classifacl error propagation 
and discusses convergence.

Start here if you are new to this technique. Having used Python before surely helps!

## Modules ToDo
 - Non Gaussian distributed errors
 - Correlated uncertainties
